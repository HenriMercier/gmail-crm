# gmail-crm

A Chrome Extension to make GMail linkable to your CRM.
Make Gmail more usable to handle client support by adding links to your company CRM.

Specify a set of links to you CRM that will be displayed next to the sender card in an email.
You can configure the links in the options, so you're just on click away from "example.com/admin/user/email=jonhdoe@somewhere.com" and don't have to make a damn copy/paste to the search engine of your CRM.

Links are always prefixed with "https://" to avoid sending email adresses on http.
